                          Examples: "Let's subtract 2 from 9" or "How many do we have left?"

                          When you think of it this way, learning the Times Tables makes sense.
                          
                          Let's take the 3 times tables, for example.  Students usually learn the 3 times tables this way:
                          
                          1 x 3 = 3</p>

              If you are looking beyond textbooks, assessment books and worksheets, then this is the place for you! This site is for anyone who wants a clearer understanding of elementary school Math.
              
              Explanations of complex Math concepts are broken down for easy learning.
              
              Each elementary Math concept is explained in various ways so your child can understand it in the way that suits him or her.
              
             Children have too much written work at school, so I have included lots of learning games for your child to practice what he or she has learnt.You can also use the flashcards and games found here to organize Math clubs with the kids in your neighborhood.

             The best way to teach your child is to go through the topics systematically as they appear in the navigation on the left. Each topic builds the foundation needed for harder concepts.Even if your child is already good in Math, it is advisable to go through all the topics to plug any gaps he or she might have or strengthen his or her understanding.</p>
